## Innovative Idea
Our innovative idea is a Student Personal Finance Web App. There are many versions of personal finance apps out there but none of them aid young adults in understanding their finances better. Students all across the world constantly fall into debt and live paycheck to paycheck because they don't understand how to track expenses ultimately saving money. Our project focuses on the perspective of the young adult just starting their financial journey and aids them in understanding their personal finances. Our project will allow users to manage their personal finances in an easy and intuitive way. The main data they would upload is their expenses, assets, revenue, recommended savings amount and monthly net income. Our target users would be young adults primarily individuals in college. 

## Important Components
Users will upload their information such as their expenses or income. Then we will store their data in a table with the date it was uploaded. This will make looking at their data easy and clear for the user to view. We will then have running totals of their total expenses during the current month as well as a monthly net income data point that will allow them to see how much leftover income they have left. Also, we will have a recommended savings amount where we will take the monthly net income and deduce how much the user should be saving for that current month. Lastly, we will implement an authentication form to ensure that each user is receiving their personal data and no information is shared with unauthorized users.
