## Innovative Idea
Our innovative idea is a Student Personal Finance Web App. There are many versions of personal finance apps out there but none of them aid young adults in understanding their finances better. Students all across the world constantly fall into debt and live paycheck to paycheck because they don't understand how to track expenses ultimately saving money. Our project focuses on the perspective of the young adult just starting their financial journey and aids them in understanding their personal finances. Our project will allow users to manage their personal finances in an easy and intuitive way. The main data they would upload is their expenses, assets, revenue, debt ratio and monthly net income. Our target users would be young adults primarily individuals in college.
